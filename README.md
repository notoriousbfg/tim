# The Tim Programming Language
Tim is an interpreted programming language. Almost everything in Tim is designed to be iterable.

"Oh, the horror!" I hear you say? Working with Tim is (at least I think) a fairly enjoyable way to write simple, fast programs.

Tim is my first language and I'm sure (at least for a while) it will be rough around the edges. If you have any experience in language design, please do reach out or contribute; I'd love to pick your brain. As always is the case in programming, we're constantly learning.

## Getting started
TBC...

## Wait, isn't it terribly egotistical to name the language after yourself?
There were many reasons for naming the language Tim. Notably, there wasn't another language with the same name nor any `.tim` file extension in existence.

When friends ask me I give them some variation of the following:

When my sister was about to give birth to her first child, a boy (also around the time I started writing this language) the subject of my own name arose. I've never really liked "Tim" (mostly because I think us Tims embody the name). Tim isn't a very popular name these days, despite the handful of famous Tims: Tim Berners-Lee, Tim Cook, Timothy Spall, Tim Peake, Timothe√© Chalamet (alright, that one's a little contentious). For a while I considered changing it by deed poll (something you can do in the UK relatively cheaply) but the Tim programming language is me doubling-down on the name. As the language becomes more popular, so does the name.
